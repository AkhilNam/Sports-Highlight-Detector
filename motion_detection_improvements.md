# Motion Detection Improvements

## Planned Enhancements

### 1. Adaptive Thresholding
- Replace fixed threshold (25) with adaptive thresholding
- Automatically adjust based on lighting conditions and camera quality
- Makes system more robust in different environments

### 2. Motion Region Analysis
- Analyze where motion is occurring in the frame
- Weight motion differently based on location
- Prioritize motion in center of frame vs. edges
- Could help distinguish between game action and crowd movement

### 3. Temporal Smoothing
- Add buffer to prevent false positives
- Implement moving average of motion scores
- Help distinguish between:
  - Real game action
  - Camera shakes
  - Quick cuts
  - Other noise

### 4. Sport-Specific Parameters
- Add sport-specific motion thresholds
- Different sports have different motion patterns
- Example thresholds:
  - Basketball: Higher sensitivity (fast breaks, dunks)
  - Baseball: Lower sensitivity (pitches, hits)
  - Soccer: Medium sensitivity (goals, saves)

### 5. Performance Optimization
- Frame downsampling for faster processing
- Options:
  - Process every other frame
  - Reduce resolution
  - Region of interest processing
- Especially important for live stream mode

## Implementation Priority
1. Get basic pipeline working first
2. Test with real sports footage
3. Implement improvements based on testing results
4. Add features one at a time, testing each change

## Testing Considerations
- Test with different sports
- Test with different camera angles
- Test in different lighting conditions
- Test with both live and recorded footage
